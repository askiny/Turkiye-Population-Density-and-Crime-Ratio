# Turkiye-Population-Density-and-Crime-Ratio

In this project, population density maps will be made on the basis of provinces and districts by combining GADM's provincial and district map data with TUIK's census data. Finally, a crime rate map will be prepared by adding TUIK's crime data.

# Subjects

- Creating a density map according to districts by combining TUIK's district census data with GADM's district map.
- Obtaining population density data by province by combining TURKSTAT's provincial census data with GADM's district map. Then, by combining TUIK's provincial crime numbers data with population density data, a map of crime rates by provinces is obtained.

# Libraries Used

- Data Proccesing: Pandas, Json, Requests, Openpyxl, Geopandas, Unidecode,
- Maps: Matplotlib, Mapclassify
